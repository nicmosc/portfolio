# NodeJS template
A NodeJS template using a Hapi server. It consists of a default page and an About page put there as a placeholder.

### What is used
- Hapi server
- Webpack for the resource bundling
- Less for the styles
- Handlebars for templating

## Installation
Clone the project. Then, inside the project folder, run in a terminal:

```bash
$ npm i && npm run dev
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:4000

## Usage
You can use this template (Boilerplate) for simple static websites, such as a portfolio, a company website or anything really. You only need to add pages, style them and do something cool with them through JavaScript if you like. To add views please refer to the Hapi [documentation] (https://hapijs.com/tutorials/views).
